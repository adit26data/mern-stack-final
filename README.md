# Shopper.com
# About this project
This is a full stack project revolving around an Ecommerce Site that I have named Shopper.com-One stop destination for all your shoppping desires!
This project contains all user functionality like user order, add to cart functions, review posting and shipping mechanism. This is a pet project I have made to learn and understand full stack in more depth.
